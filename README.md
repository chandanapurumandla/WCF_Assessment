# WCF_Assessment
1. CellPhone and CellPhoneUsage are the Model Classes.
2. I have created CellPhone.csv and CellPhoneUsageByMonth.csv files to store data. The data could be even pulled from database or github using Webservices.
3. CellPhoneReport.java contains the logic to read the data from CSV files to list objects. I used the list objects and built the report.
   I have written the report to a CSV file named Report.csv

Note: All the CSV files are part of the Project. Attached the Project structure for reference.
